# Transmission Line Analysis Using MATLAB GUI

Portfolio project describing a MATLAB GUI–based engineering tool developed for
analyzing overhead transmission line geometry using electrical and mechanical
parameters. The project focused on understanding the relationship between conductor
configuration, line geometry, and transmission efficiency.

The work was carried out as an applied engineering project using MATLAB, with
emphasis on practical parameter analysis, visualization, and decision support
rather than deployable software.
