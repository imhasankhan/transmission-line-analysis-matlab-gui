# Transmission Line Analysis Using MATLAB GUI

Portfolio project describing a MATLAB GUI–based engineering tool developed for
analyzing overhead transmission line geometry using electrical and mechanical
parameters. The project focused on understanding the relationship between conductor
configuration, line geometry, and transmission efficiency.

The work was carried out as an applied engineering project using MATLAB, with
emphasis on practical parameter analysis, visualization, and decision support
rather than deployable software.

## Project Overview

The MATLAB GUI was designed to assist in the analysis of overhead transmission
line geometry by allowing engineers to study the impact of different electrical
and mechanical parameters on line performance.

The tool conceptually supported:
- Input of transmission line configuration parameters (conductor spacing,
  geometry arrangement, and physical properties)
- Evaluation of electrical characteristics influenced by line geometry
- Analysis of how geometric variations affect transmission efficiency and losses
- Interactive exploration of parameter changes through a graphical user interface

The project emphasized engineering insight and visualization rather than
automation or large-scale simulation.

## Engineering Concepts & Skills Demonstrated

- Overhead transmission line geometry and configuration analysis
- Relationship between mechanical line arrangement and electrical performance

## Project Scope & Notes

- This project was implemented as a MATLAB GUI during an earlier academic phase,
  and the original implementation files are no longer available
- The repository serves as a portfolio case study describing the project concept,
  engineering approach, and learning outcomes
- The focus is on demonstrating applied power system understanding and MATLAB
  usage rather than providing a runnable software package
- The descriptions reflect the original project functionality to the best of
  current recollection and documentation
